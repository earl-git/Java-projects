# Java-projects

This repository contains Java programs worked on in school that demonstrate various programming concepts. Each program serves as an example of solving different problems using Java.

## Projects Included

### 1. Present Value Calculator

Calculates the present value required to achieve a desired future value given an annual interest rate and number of years. The program prompts the user for the following inputs:
- Desired future value
- Annual interest rate
- Number of years

**File:** `PresentValueCalc.java`

### 2. Distance Conversion Program

Converts a distance given in meters into different units based on the userâ€™s choice. It displays a menu where the user can choose to:
1. Convert meters to kilometers
2. Convert meters to inches
3. Convert meters to feet
4. Quit the program

The program ensures the distance input is non-negative and allows users to make multiple conversions until they choose to quit.

**File:** `ConversionProgram.java`

### 3. Test Average and Grade Calculator

Calculates the average of five test scores entered by the user and determines the corresponding letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) for each score as well as the overall average score. Grading scale:
- 90 and above: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- Below 60: F

It outputs both individual grades for each test and the average score with the corresponding letter grade.
